# Clear locally stored data

If you agreed to it when visiting VedaWeb for the first time, it uses the local storage of your browser to remember a few settings you made, such as search settings or the search term you last entered into a search field. The next time you visit VedaWeb, these settings would still be there for you to use. This is meant as a convenience feature. No personal data will be stored this way.

If you want to delete this locally stored data, you can easily do so by clicking the button at the bottom of the page that says "Delete locally stored settings".

## Why would I want to delete these settings?

If we make a breaking change to our application, it is possible that visiting the new version of the website with old settings data might cause an error. So if you expercience any errors, you can always try to delete your old settings. This has been reported to work in the past, so maybe it will help you, too.
